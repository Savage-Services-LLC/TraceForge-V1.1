💍 Dual Asset Routing

TraceForge-V1.2 supports two asset classes:

- Hardware: RC boards, satellite modules, teardown-grade salvage
- Jewelry: Vintage rings, pendants, maker’s mark decoding

Each asset is routed through branded CLI modules, assessed for salvage grade, and injected with resale overlays.

---

🚀 Getting Started

`bash
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
`

Follow prompts to select asset type and route through teardown or overlay modules.

---

🛡️ Audit & Trust

Every module logs to .audit/ with timestamped asset IDs. Overlays include provenance, salvage grade, and teardown notes—reinforcing buyer trust and forensic traceability.
